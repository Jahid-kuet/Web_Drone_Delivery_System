# ✅ Complete System Fixes & Testing Guide - October 5, 2025

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed Successfully!

---

## 🔧 **Issues That Were Fixed:**

### **1. Login Behavior** ✅
**Status:** This is **correct behavior** - not an error!
- When you visit `/login` while **already authenticated**, you're automatically redirected to dashboard
- This is standard Laravel authentication behavior
- To see the login page, you must **logout first**

**How to test:**
```
1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/logout (logout first)
2. Then visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/login (now you'll see login page)
```

### **2. Medical Supplies Column Error** ✅ **FIXED**
**Error:**
```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'quantity_in_stock'
```

**Root Cause:**
- Controllers used `quantity_in_stock`
- Database column is `quantity_available`

**Fixed in 3 locations:**
1. ✅ `MedicalSupplyController.php` line 50 - Stock filter (out of stock)
2. ✅ `MedicalSupplyController.php` line 53 - Stock filter (adequate stock)
3. ✅ `MedicalSupplyController.php` line 81 - Statistics (out_of_stock count)
4. ✅ `MedicalSupplyController.php` line 109 - Validation rules

**Now both URLs work:**
- ✅ http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/supplies
- ✅ http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/medical-supplies
