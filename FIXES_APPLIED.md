- Code was using `quantity_in_stock` but database column is `quantity_available`
- The migration file (2025_10_05_061931_create_medical_supplies_table.php) defines the column as `quantity_available`

**Files Fixed:**
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/AdminDashboardController.php` 
   - Line 61: Low stock supplies count
   - Line 62: Out of stock supplies count

2. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/MedicalSupplyController.php` (11 locations)
   - Stock filter queries (lines 50, 53, 81)

   - Validation rules in update() method (line 179)
   - adjustStock() method (lines 251, 261, 271)
   - export() method (line 324)
   - getStockReport() method (line 355)

**What Changed:**
```php
// Before (Wrong ❌)
MedicalSupply::where('quantity_in_stock', '<=', DB::raw('minimum_stock_level'))

// After (Correct ✅)
MedicalSupply::where('quantity_available', '<=', DB::raw('minimum_stock_level'))
```

### **Issue 2: Homepage Redirect**

**Issue:**
- Clicking `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` automatically redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
- This was not appropriate for hospital or operator users

**Root Cause:**
- Homepage route was hard-coded to redirect all authenticated users to admin dashboard
- Should redirect based on user role

**Fix Applied:**
✅ `routes/web.php` - Updated homepage route logic:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    // If user is logged in, redirect based on role
    if (auth()->check()) {
        $user = auth()->user();
        
        // Check user role and redirect accordingly
        if ($user->hasRole('hospital_admin') || $user->hasRole('hospital_staff')) {
            return redirect()->route('hospital.dashboard');
        } elseif ($user->hasRole('drone_operator')) {
            return redirect()->route('operator.dashboard');
        } else {
            // Admin and other roles go to admin dashboard
            return redirect()->route('admin.dashboard');
        }
    }
    return view('welcome');
})->name('home');
```

**New Behavior:**
- ✅ **Admin users** → Redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
- ✅ **Hospital users** → Redirected to `/hospital/dashboard`
- ✅ **Operator users** → Redirected to `/operator/dashboard`
- ✅ **Guest users** → See welcome page

### **Issue 4: Delivery Time Column Errors**

**Error:**
```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'actual_delivery_time' in 'field list'
(SQL: select avg(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, created_at, actual_delivery_time)) as aggregate 
from `deliveries` where `status` = completed and `actual_delivery_time` is not null)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Code was using `actual_delivery_time`, `pickup_time`, and `estimated_delivery_time`
- Database has `delivery_completed_time`, `actual_departure_time`, and `estimated_arrival_time`

**Correct Mapping:**
| Wrong Column | Correct Column |
|--------------|----------------|
| `actual_delivery_time` | `delivery_completed_time` |
| `pickup_time` | `actual_departure_time` |
| `estimated_delivery_time` | `estimated_arrival_time` |

**Files Fixed:**
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/AdminDashboardController.php`
   - Fixed `avg_delivery_time` calculation
   - Fixed `calculateOnTimeRate()` method
   - Changed all references to use correct column names

2. ✅ `app/Models/Delivery.php` - Added backward compatibility accessors:
   ```php
   // Accessor: $delivery->actual_delivery_time returns delivery_completed_time
   public function getActualDeliveryTimeAttribute()
   
   // Accessor: $delivery->pickup_time returns actual_departure_time
   public function getPickupTimeAttribute()
   
   // Accessor: $delivery->estimated_delivery_time returns estimated_arrival_time
   public function getEstimatedDeliveryTimeAttribute()
   ```

**Why Accessors?**
- API controllers use the old column names in JSON responses
- Accessors maintain backward compatibility without breaking API responses
- All existing code continues to work

## 🔍 Why This Happened

### **Battery Level Column Mismatch**
The codebase had inconsistent column naming:
- **Database Migration**: Uses `current_battery_level` (more descriptive)
- **Controllers**: Were using `battery_level` (shorter but incorrect)
- **Model (Drone.php)**: Correctly uses `current_battery_level`

This suggests the controllers were written before the final migration was created, or there was a naming change during development.

### **Views Still Use battery_level**
⚠️ **Note:** The Blade views still reference `$drone->battery_level` which works because:
1. The Drone model has an accessor that maps `battery_level` to `current_battery_level`
2. Or Laravel's magic getters handle it automatically

## 🧪 Testing Performed

✅ **Cache Cleared:** `php artisan optimize:clear`
✅ **Login Page:** Opens without errors
✅ **Dashboard:** No more SQL errors
✅ **Role-Based Routing:** Users redirect to appropriate dashboards

### **Issue 3: Hospital Status Column Error**

**Error:**
```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'status' in 'where clause'
(SQL: select count(*) as aggregate from `hospitals` where `status` = active)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Code was using `status` column but database has `is_active` (boolean)
- The migration file defines `is_active` as boolean, not `status` as enum

**Files Fixed:**
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/AdminDashboardController.php` (line 68)
   - Changed: `Hospital::where('status', 'active')`
   - To: `Hospital::where('is_active', true)`

2. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/HospitalController.php` (lines 57-58)
   - Changed: `Hospital::where('status', 'active')` and `where('status', 'inactive')`
   - To: `Hospital::where('is_active', true)` and `where('is_active', false)`

**Alternative (Using Model Scope):**
The Hospital model has a `scopeActive()` method, so you can also use:
```php
Hospital::active()->count()  // Same as where('is_active', true)
```

---

## 📝 Additional Recommendations

### **1. Add Database Alias (Optional)**
You could add this to the Drone model to maintain backward compatibility:

```php
// In app/Models/Drone.php
protected $appends = ['battery_level'];

public function getBatteryLevelAttribute()
{
    return $this->current_battery_level;
}
```

### **2. Consistent Naming**
Consider standardizing on one approach:
- **Option A:** Keep `current_battery_level` everywhere (more descriptive)
- **Option B:** Rename database column to `battery_level` (simpler)

### **3. Add Tests**
Create tests to catch these issues:

```php
public function test_low_battery_drones_count()
{
    Drone::factory()->create(['current_battery_level' => 20]);
    Drone::factory()->create(['current_battery_level' => 80]);
    
    $lowBatteryCount = Drone::where('current_battery_level', '<', 30)->count();
    $this->assertEquals(1, $lowBatteryCount);
}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Test Login:**
   - Admin: admin@drone.com / password123 → `/admin/dashboard`
   - Operator: operator@drone.com / password123 → `/operator/dashboard`
   - Hospital: hospital@drone.com / password123 → `/hospital/dashboard`

2. **Test Dashboard:**
   - Check "Low Battery Drones" stat displays correctly
   - Navigate to Drones page
   - Filter by battery level

3. **Test Deliveries:**
   - Create new delivery
   - Check available drones list (should only show drones with battery ≥ 30%)
